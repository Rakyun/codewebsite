          In today's fast-paced world, it's clear that technology is driving a
          lot of the progress we see. And for kids growing up now, who will
          eventually shape the world, they have easy and fast access to
          technology from a young age. That's why learning to code is so
          important for them.

          "Coding is like giving instructions to a computer using a special
          language." Normally, computers can't think or do things on their own.
          So, we use specific languages to tell them what to do. We just call
          these languages "programming languages" for computers.

          "Today, nearly all the technology we encounter daily stems from
          computer programming. Whether it's the applications on our
          smartphones, programs running on computers, or even children's video
          games, they all exemplify creations made possible through coding."
