Beginning with crafting their own 3D models, understanding electrical circuits, and mastering the integration of embedded systems to bring their creations to life. Beyond mechanical principles, our aim is to instill in them an engineering mindsetâ€”a mindset that sparks curiosity, problem- solving, and innovation.",

Through hands-on activities and interactive learning experiences, students develop critical thinking skills and apply engineering principles to real- world scenarios.",
